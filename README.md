# NodeJS Skill-up Project / Clinical Trials Search API

## Motivation
Skill-up project up on the tech stack described below.

## Tech
1) Async primitives:  async-await
2) Test framework: Jest / Supertest
3) HTTP server framework: Express (e.g. routers, middleware)
4) HTTP client: Axios
5) ~~HTTP Request GUI:  Paw (Postman is an option too but server devs are all on Paw now)~~
6) Docker
7) Data Formats: YAML, JSON
8) PostgreSQL
9) ~~Redis~~
10) Swagger / JSON Schema
11) ~~CI/CD: CircleCI, Harness~~
12) ElasticSearch
13) ~~Infrastructure as code:  Terraform~~

Avoiding ORM as I believe it's a leaky abstraction, but I did decide to add a relation db query builder -> knex.
This is arguable another leaky abstraction, but it's very close to SQL but provides a few security and convenience features.

## Architecture
[![Uncle Bob clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
Leveraging clean architecture to ensure business logic is not coupled to the tech choices.
>"The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle."

To highlight this fact this project adds support for two repositories (PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch) as well as two http 
frameworks (Express and Hapi).
