## Motivation
Basic upskill project on the tech stack described below.

## Tech Stack
1) NodeJS
2) Async primitives:  async-await
3) Test framework: Jest / Supertest
4) HTTP server framework: Express (e.g. routers, middleware)
   - @apidevtools/swagger-express-middleware
5) HTTP client: Axios
6) ~~HTTP Request GUI:  Paw (Postman is an option too but server devs are all on Paw now)~~
7) Docker
8) Data Formats: YAML, JSON
9) PostgreSQL
10) ~~Redis~~ - In the early phase of development - disabled caching on purpose
11) Swagger / JSON Schema
12) CI/CD: CircleCI, Harness - work in progress
13) ElasticSearch
14) ~~Infrastructure as code:  Terraform~~


Avoiding ORM as I believe it's a leaky abstraction, but I did decide to add a relation db query builder -> knex.
This is arguable another leaky abstraction, but it's very close to SQL and provides a few security and convenience features.

## Architecture
[![Uncle Bob clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/images/2012-08-13-the-clean-architecture/CleanArchitecture.jpg)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
Leveraging clean architecture to ensure business logic is not coupled to the tech choices.
>"The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is The Dependency Rule. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle." - Bob Martin

To highlight this fact this project adds support for two repositories (PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch) as well as two http 
frameworks (Express and Hapi). Note: As currently implemented Hapi does not support swagger nor supertest.

## Project Structure

```
root 
 └ /lib                             → Application source code 
    └ application                   → Application services
       └ use_cases                  → Application business logic 
    └ domain                        → Domain model objects and repository interfaces
    └ infrastructure                → Frameworks, and tools such as Databases, and other tools
       └ config                     → Configuration including the service-locator which is the source for dependency inversion
       └ repositories               → Implementation of domain repository interfaces (postgresql, elasticsearch)
       └ webserver                  → Web server configuration (server, routes, plugins/middleware, etc.) - expressjs and hapi
    └ interfaces                    → Adapters and formatters for use cases and entities to external agency such as Database or the Web
       └ controllers                → Route handlers
       └ expressjs-routes           → express route definitions
       └ hapijs-routes              → Hapi route definitions
       └ serializers                → Converter objects that transform internal data to the outside world and the inverse
 └ /node_modules (generated)        → NPM dependencies
 └ /docs                            → swagger.json and various readme resources
 └ /test                            → Source folder for unit or integration/supertest tests
 └ index.js                         → Main application entry point
 └ Dockerfile                       → Dockerfile to scaffold PostgreSQL with data
 └ init.sql                         → PostgreSQL SQL to create table, insert data, & index
```

## Installation
```
1) git clone https://github.com/jessehjackman/clinical-trials.git
2) cd clinical-trials
3) rename/move template.env -> .env (update if desired) 
4) configure PostgreSQL
    a) docker build -t covid-trials-postgres-image .
    b) docker run -d --name covid-trials-postgres-container -p 5555:5432 covid-trials-postgres-image
    C) If desired you may run init.sql on an existing PostgreSQL server
4) npm install
5) npm test
6) npm start

(optional) Config Elasticsearch by following AWS directions and setting the appropriate env settings,
 e.g. endpoint and master username + password. I did not include the raw data here but you can extract 
 it from init.sql or from PostgreSQL directly.

```
## API Reference
Swagger docs available at the /api-docs endpoint upon installation (express framework only)

i.e. http://localhost:3000/api-docs/#/covid/find-covid-trials

## Test

### Performance 
#### ClinicJs Doctor : baseline
![baseline-clinicdoctor.png](doc/readme/baseline-clinicdoctor.png)

![baseline-autocannon.png](doc/readme/baseline-autocannon.png)

#### Against un-indexed full text search:

#### With full text search index

## TODO
- Retry logic
- Logging
- Health Check end point  
- Maybe add query parameters for: (is) results available, number of enrolled?
- Complete test plan
    - Further integration tests / supertest, fake certain invalid db records
    - Unit tests on validation, serialization/xform
- Replace require with import/from per ECMA 6
- Circle CI
- Secure the 'query' parameter in PostgreSQL
- Fix an unclosed handle issue with super test
- Wire in Hapi JS into supertest
- Add swagger docs to Hapi JS
